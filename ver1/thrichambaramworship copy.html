                <h3>Moonnambalam</h3>
                <p>
                    Taliparamba Temple is also connected with two more temples—Thrichambaram Sree Krishna Temple and Kanjirangad Sree Vaidyanatha Temple. Taliparamba, Thrichambaram, and Kanjirangad temples are collectively called <strong>Moonnambalams</strong> (three temples). Those who visit Taliparamba temple should also visit Thrichambaram and Kanjirangad temples. Visit to these three temples is called <strong>Moonnambalam Thozhal</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though it is not practised as widely as it was in the earlier days, it is still a religious custom among many local Hindu women to visit these prominent temples in Taliparamba when they are pregnant. For getting good children and for normal delivery, pregnant women (before 5 months) usually visit these three temples. It is believed that Shiva at Rajarajeshwara temple assures the child a high status, Sri Krishna of Trichambaram bestows good nature and mental qualities, and the deity Vaidyanatha at Kanjirangad temple grants long life.
